      <p>How would the positions of different resources on the map change your decision-making?</p>
      <P>How do the actions of the other teams change your decision-making? If you didn't see anyone going for the central village, would that matter for your strategy?</P>
      <p>Does it matter how many teams are on the map? Is competing more or less risky when there are more teams in play? What if there was only one other team?</p>
      <p>If you chose to compete for the central village but another team got it, how would that impact your strategy for the rest of the game?</p>
