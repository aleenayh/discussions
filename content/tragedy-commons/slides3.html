        <p>This week's conversation is about <b>The Tragedy of the Commons.</b></p>
        <p>It's a classic conflict about how society manages <b>shared resources …</b></p>
        <p>… against <b>individual interests.</b></p>
        <img src="images/img12.gif" class="slideImg">
        <p>Today, you'll act as <b>judges to three court cases</b> and decide how the resources should be used.</p>
        <p>Here's the catch: each scenario is based on real events.</p>
        <p>After you make your decision, we'll show you what actually happened.</p>
        <img src="images/img13.png" class="slideImg">
        <p>Scenario 1: Fishing. </p>
        <p>A coastal city has rich fishing grounds, abundant with sea life.</p>
        <p>As such, the city has always had a successful fishing industry.</p>
        <img src="images/img14.gif" class="slideImg">
        <p>But fishing life is very hard labor for very little money.</p>
        <p>Now, larger and more efficient fishing boats can make life easier for fishing families….</p>
        <p>… and more profitable.</p>
        <img src="images/img15.gif" class="slideImg">
        <p>However, these boats catch a lot more fish. Some people in the community worry about overfishing.</p>
        <p>The conflict has ended up in your hands.</p>
        <p>You'll be judging this case. The question is, have you already formed an opinion <b>before hearing the arguments?</b></p>
