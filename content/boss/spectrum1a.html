            <div class="cyoaResult">You didn't hire the Quality Assurance Supervisor. Without them to uphold quality, could rushing to finish jobs harm the company's reputation? Seems risky…</div>
            <div class="cyoaResult">You didn't hire the Head painter. You’ll lack a role model for quality and consistency. Does this makes sense? Seems risky…</div>
            <div class="cyoaResult">You didn't hire the Project Scheduler. With multiple projects across multiple clients, you won’t have anyone to organize and coordinate deadlines. Is this a smart move? Seems risky…</div>
            <div class="cyoaResult">You didn't hire the Apprentice. You may be forgetting that a Junior Painter a) works cheap, b) learns fast, and c) becomes the future of the company. Are you being short-sighted here? Seems risky…</div>
            <div class="cyoaResult">You didn't hire the Sales Developer. Sales means income. Without this, how are you going to stay in business long-term? Was this the right choice? Seems risky…</div>
