      <p>If the government makes the rules for safety at work, how can they know what's safe for all kinds of jobs, from
        building houses to baking cakes?</p>

      <p>If a group of workers (called a union) decides the safety rules, can they really make sure every worker, no
        matter their job, feels safe and protected?</p>

      <p>If the boss of a company chooses the safety rules, how can they make sure they're thinking of the workers'
        safety and not just saving money?</p>

      <p>If every worker picks their own safety rules, how can the company make sure everyone is safe and that some
        people aren't taking too many risks?</p>
        <p>What's the worst that could happen if this choice was left to the wrong decider?</p>

      <p>A <b>safe work environment</b> is important, no doubt.</p>

      <P>But with <b>different types</b> of environments and different types of work, who gets to set the bar for what “safe” is?
