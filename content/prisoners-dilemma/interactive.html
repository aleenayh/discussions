        <div class="context"><h>The Situation</h> While your parents were out today, you and your sibling Jordan went swimming 
          and both tracked water all over the new hardwood floors. Your parents come home and want to know who's responsible. 
          They're asking each of you separately. Should you tell them Jordan did it? Or say nothing? Why?</div>
        <div class="context"><h>The Situation</h> This afternoon a lamp was broken. You were in your room when it happened and 
          you have no idea who's responsible. It could have been Jordan, or it could have been a pet. Your parents are asking 
          each of you separately. You don't know what Jordan will say - there's a possibility you might be blamed. Should you 
          blame Jordan, or stay quiet?</div>
        <div class="context"><h>The Situation</h> You saw Jordan knock a picture off the wall and break the frame. Jordan hid 
          it but you parents come home and see the empty spot on the wall and want to know what happened. You don't know what 
          Jordan will tell them. Will you tell them Jordan did it, or say nothing?</div>
        <div class="context"><h>The Situation</h> Your parents made a cake for one of their friends' birthdays and left it in 
          the refrigerator. You didn't know what it was for and ate some, and now they can't take it with them. They seem really 
          mad... should you blame it on Jordan, or say nothing?</div>
        <div class="context"><h>The Situation</h> A friend of yours who lives across the street was playing outside and accidentally 
          threw a ball through your window. You and Jordan both saw it happen. You know for sure that your friend won't admit it, and 
          when your parents come home they are once again asking you and Jordan what happened. You <i>could</i> blame your friend... 
          but if Jordan blames <i>you,</i> your parents probably won't believe you. What should you do?</div>
