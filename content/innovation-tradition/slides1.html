    <P>This week's topic explores a classic conflict:</p>
    <P><b>Tradition:</b> keeping things the same because they continue to work.<br><br>
      <b>Innovation:</b> looking to the future to improve the way things are.</p>

    <P>Which approach is better? <br><br>
      <b>It depends.</b> Both approaches have risks.</p>
    <video autoplay loop muted playsinline class="slideImg">
      <source src="images/board.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    <P>Here's the situation:</p>

    <P>We are the Executive Board of an educational company.</p>

    <P>We want your group to design <b>a brand new school.</b></p>

    <video autoplay loop muted playsinline class="slideImg">
      <source src="images/building.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    <P>Here are the rules:</p>

    <P>Your school must be <b>highly effective.</b> We'll ask you to consider a few areas
    specifically.</p>

    <P>In each area, you will choose between <b>traditional</b> approaches 
      or <b>innovative</b> approaches.</p>
    <video autoplay loop muted playsinline class="slideImg">
      <source src="images/building.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    <P>Here's the catch.</p>

    <P>All teams in this session will vote on each area. Your school plan will need to incorporate the 
      option with the majority votes.
    </p>

    <P>So all groups will build their school with the same constraints. 
    </p>


    <video autoplay loop muted playsinline class="slideImg">
      <source src="images/board.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    <P>At the end, we'll ask you to pitch us your plan.
      You room will compete against other teams.</p>

    <P>Which team will have the <b>best pitch?</b></p>

    <P>Since all teams will use the same school plan,
      it's not about what's included &ndash; it's about how you back those decisions up
      and explain your thinking. We're curious to see what you come up with.
