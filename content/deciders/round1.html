      <p>If the government says how long everyone should work, how can they make sure it's fair for all kinds of jobs,
        like doctors, teachers, and farmers?</p>

      <p>If a group of workers (called a union) decides how long they should work, how can they make sure it's good for
        everyone in different jobs within that group?</p>

      <p>If the boss of a company chooses how long everyone works, how can they make sure it's best for the workers and
        not just the company?</p>

      <p>If everyone picks their own work hours, how can the company make sure everyone gets their work done and can
        work together when needed?</p>
      <p>What's the worst that could happen if this choice was left to the wrong decider?</p>

      <h>I: Work Week</h>
    </p>

    <p>There's a debate about the <b>number of hours</b> an employee should work
      each week.<span class="flexBreak"></span>
      Some argue to keep the <b>standard 5 day week,</b> others think a
      <b>reduced week</b> is healthier.
    </p>

    <p> The decision has to be made somewhere. But at what level?</p>
