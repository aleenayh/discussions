      <p>Are old books better than new ones? If so, what makes them better?</p>

      <p>What makes a book "classic"? <br><br> Who decides which books are "classic"?</p>
      
      <p>Do all books help you learn? <br><br>Do all books help you learn the same amount?</p>
      
      <p>Is it important for everyone in class read the same book?<br><br>If everyone in class read different books, how would that change the rest of the class structure?</p>
      
      <p>We've heard from parents that they think old books have bigger ideas than new ones. Do you agree?</p>
      
      <p>Can kids pick good books on their own? How will we know if they're learning enough?</p>
      
      <p>One of our investors thinks classics are outdated and there's nothing new we can learn from them. How would you respond to that?</p>
      
      <p>Which books would make more kids excited about reading?</p>
      
      <p>What's the point of having kids read in school, anyway? What are we really trying to accomplish here?</p>

    <p>Here's the next discussion point: <b>reading lists.</b></p>

    <P>Should students read <b>classic literature from around the world</b>, 
      on a schedule decided by a teacher?</P>

    <p>Or should students <b>make their own reading curriculum</b>, reading 
      whatever they find most interesting and engaging? </p>
