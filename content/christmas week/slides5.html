        <p>Imagine you are on the local school board, and a tech company wants you to pilot their latest invention...
        </p>
        <p><B>Robo-Educators</B>. These robots can teach any subject flawlessly, 
          tailor lessons to individual student needs, and operate 24/7. </p>
        <p>But making the switch isn't without risks.
          With the future of education at stake, which direction do you steer?
        </p>

        <P><B>1. Switch all classrooms.</B> Replace all human teachers with Robo-Educators
        for the upcoming school year.</P>
        <P><b>2. Robo-Teaching Assistants.</b> Keep teachers human, but use robots for 
        roles like tutors or lab assistants.</P>
        <p><b>3. Switch some classrooms.</b> Put Robo-Educators in some classrooms, and let
        parents choose if they want a human or robot teacher for the upcoming school year.</p>
        
<P><b>4. Human-AI classrooms.</b> For each classroom with a Robo-Educator, 
keep a human teacher on staff to supervise and help mentor students.</P>
<p><b>5. Stay human.</b> Turn the tech company down, and keep your human teachers.</p>
<P>Other school districts are watching, so your choice has an impact 
  on the future of education. What will you choose?
