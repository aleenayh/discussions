  <p>I'm the tech wizard behind the scenes. 
    I take the creative visions and code them into functional websites. 
    Without me, your clients won't have a website. No website, no business. </p>

  <P>I'm the face of the studio, always on the hunt for new clients. I have a magnetic personality and easily make connections with people. If your clients don't like working with someone, they'll probably go somewhere else. I make sure that doesn't happen. </P>

<div class="speechBubble" id="characterCTalk">
<P>I've always had a way with creative projects. I craft content so that each website not only <i>looks good,</i> but also tells a captivating story that brings in an audience. After all, if it doesn't, our clients aren't happy. What's more important than that? </P>

<p>I oversee communications and make sure deadlines are met 
  and resources are smartly allocated. My strategic vision keeps the team unified and efficient. 
  Without me, missed deadlines and client dissatisfaction could spell disaster for the business. </p>
