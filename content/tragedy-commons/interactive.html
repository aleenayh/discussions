        <p class="qa1">Other businesses, like local restaurants and tourism, could actually benefit if we conserve. More
          fish means a more sustainable fishing industry and a more attractive destination for tourists.</p>
        <p class="qa2">The environment, of course! We must have seasonal limits and stricter quotas. This way, the fish
          have time to repopulate, ensuring a future for both the fish industry and the ecosystem of the ocean.</p>
        <p class="qa3">Do you think the owners of these huge boats will raise the salaries of their employees? Not
          likely! Selling more fish is only going to benefit a small number of people.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="speechBubble" id="advisorB"><button class="closeBubble">X</button>
        <p class="qa1">If fishing is booming, everyone wins. Gear shops sell more equipment, and restaurants get a
          steady supply of fresh fish. A thriving fishing industry has a ripple effect on the whole economy.</p>
        <p class="qa2">Ask yourself, what's more important — a human or a fish? There are plenty of fish in the sea.
          Literally. We catch thousands of fish each year, and there has never been a problem.</p>
        <p class="qa3">Sure, owners might see quick profits, but more fish means more work and more pay. Plus, this new
          technology will make our lives easier. Why wouldn't we use it?</p>

        <p class="qa1">Farmers have managed their own water for generations. We know the land, the seasons, and our crops. Why fix what isn't broken?</p>
        <p class="qa2">We're a community. If someone takes more than their share, we handle it locally. We don't need an outsider telling us what to do.</p>
        <p class="qa3">Government control would mean red tape, delays, and inefficiencies. Our farms are the backbone of the economy. Let's not mess with that.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="speechBubble" id="advisorB"><button class="closeBubble">X</button>
        <p class="qa1">It's not about taking control away from farmers. It's about ensuring fairness so that all farmers, big or small, have equal access to this critical resource.</p>
        <p class="qa2">We need a system that's fair for everyone. We can set clear rules, regulations, and penalties. That way, no one can jeopardize the community's water supply.</p>
        <p class="qa3">Actually, a centralized system could be more efficient and better coordinated, potentially increasing our national agricultural yield.</p>

      <div class="speechBubble" id="advisorA"><button class="closeBubble">X</button>
        <p class="qa1">Public transit cuts down on pollution and traffic. Yes, there might be delays, but the benefits to the community outweigh individual inconveniences.</p>
        <p class="qa2">Making sure everyone has access to transportation is crucial. It's about fairness and building a community where everyone has opportunities. A few delays are a small price to pay for a system that serves us all.</p>
        <p class="qa3">Exactly. It's bigger than just transportation. We all share the planet. We should make choices that benefit everyone, not just ourselves. What if <i>everyone</i> decided to drive their own car? It would be a disaster. Public transit solves this.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="speechBubble" id="advisorB"><button class="closeBubble">X</button>
        <p class="qa1">Cars give you freedom and flexibility. Sure, there's traffic, but it beats standing in a crowded bus or waiting for a delayed train.</p>
        <p class="qa2">Time is valuable. While it's great that public transit can serve more people, my individual efficiency shouldn't be sacrificed. Cars let you make the most of your time, which benefits you and everyone around you in the long run.</p>
        <p class="qa3">We have a right to choose what suits us best. Some people want cars for their lifestyle, or for their work, or for their family and that's okay. It's not ethical to tell someone they should ride a bus.</p>
