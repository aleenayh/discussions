      <p>Why do we get grades in school? What's the larger purpose?</p>

      <p>Do tests and quizzes impact how students feel about learning?</p>
      
      <p>Can you prove you understand something <I>without</i> a test of some kind? If so, how?</p>
      
      <p>How do grades make students feel? (Is that feeling important to the learning process, or not?)</p>
      
      <p>Can you be good at something without ever trying to measure it, like with an assignment or test?</p>
      
      <p>If we stop having regular tests, how might that change the way we teach?</p>
      
      <p>Without grades, how will teachers know which students need extra support or are ready for more challenge?</p>
      
      <p>If we don't use standardized tests, how will our students continue on to college or the workforce?</p>
      
      <p>What parts of the grading system are most valuable to student learning? Why?</p>

    <p>Now it's time to talk about <b>assessing learning.</b> Traditionally, this is done

      <P>Should we keep the discipline and rigor of the <b>standard grading system?</b></P>

      <p>Or get rid of grades and tests, instead letting students <b>reflect honestly on what they've learned?</b></p>
