      <p>Is having the same routine every day helpful for learning?</p>

      <p>What problems might come up if everyone picks their own class times? How might we solve these problems?</p>
      
      <p>How would group projects work if students have different schedules?</p>
      
      <p>Would a flexible school day make it easier for working parents to get their kids to school at the right times, or more difficult?</p>
      
      <p>Which one better prepares students for the real world: a standard schedule or a flexible schedule?</p>
      
      <p>What new opportunities might be created by a flexible schedule? Could we build those opportunities in to a standard school day, or not?</p>
      
      <p>What could students learn from setting their own school times?</p>
      
      <p>Can we trust students with the responsibility of designing their own schedule?</p>
