      <p>What prizes are you assuming? If you knew the small prize and larger prizes were, would it change your answer?</p>

<p>If you chose to spin the wheel and didn't win any prize, how would you feel? Do feelings factor in to “opportunity costs”?</p>

<P>Would knowing the odds of winning the bigger prize influence your decision? How?</p> 

<p>Does your decision in this game show mirror how you make decisions in your everyday life? If not, what makes it different?</p> 

<P>Are you generally a person who likes to take risks, or not? Does your personal risk tolerance (or risk avoidance) change the opportunity cost of this choice?</p>
